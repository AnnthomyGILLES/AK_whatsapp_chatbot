# README for ChatGPT-WhatsApp Integration App

## Introduction
This application, I created at the beginning of 2023, offers an innovative solution for integrating WhatsApp with ChatGPT. Designed for ease of use and efficiency, it connects users on WhatsApp with the advanced AI capabilities of ChatGPT, managed through MongoDB. The app also incorporates Stripe for subscription management, ensuring a seamless billing experience. Utilizing Nginx for web serving and reverse proxy capabilities and Twilio for handling WhatsApp communications, this app stands as a robust and versatile tool for both personal and business communication needs.

## How it works?
- **MongoDB User Management**: Efficiently manages user data and interactions using MongoDB.
- **Subscription Management with Stripe**: Offers subscription-based access with easy management and billing through Stripe.
- **Nginx for Web Serving**: Leverages Nginx for reliable and secure web serving and as a reverse proxy.
- **Twilio Integration**: Utilizes Twilio for handling and automating WhatsApp communication.
